## Western for Ooch Website | SheHacks 2020 Hack with Heart
The MVP of this website was made as part of the Hack with Heart initiative at SheHacks in which hackers were selected to build a project for a non-profit organization. We applied and were selected to build for the Western for Ooch chapter of Camp Ooch. We thoroughly planned and considered different factors such as the audience, flow of the landing page, and the overall narrative for the website.  

### Design 
The website was designed in Figma. Attempts were made to embody the “camp” theme of Camp Ooch and taking inspiration from the 
Western chapter’s Instagram as well as the original Camp Ooch website.

### Tech Stack
The website was built with **React.js** alongside **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** **Bootstrap** was also utilized to create a reponsive application.
The repository contains a **Python** script using the Beautiful Soup library that scrapes from the Western for Ooch GoFundMe Page to access data about the current status of the donations. It exports that data into a text file. There is then a separate folder of a **Javascript** files that creates a dynamic loading bar of the donation progress.
