## Western for Ooch Website
Welcome! This is the website made with <3 by the Western for Ooch Team Team at SheHacks 2020.
The team consisted of 8 people from different backgrounds and experiences with coding. In the 24 hours, lots was
learned designing and developing the website! 
It began with analyzing the user groups of the potential website and identifying what their key needs were: 
* About Section
* Donation Panel
* Subscription/Member SignUp
* Calendar of Invites

### Design 
The website was designed in Figma. Attempts were made to embody the “camp” theme of Camp Ooch and taking inspiration from the 
Western chapter’s Instagram as well as the original Camp Ooch website.

### Tech Stack
The website was built with **React.js** alongside **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** **Bootstrap** was also utilized to create a reponsive application.
The repository contains a **Python** script using the Beautiful Soup library that scrapes from the Western for Ooch GoFundMe Page to access data about the current status of the donations. It exports that data into a text file. There is then a separate folder of  **Javascript** that creates a dynamic loading bar of the donation progress.

Overall, everyone learned a lot and had a great time working on the website! Thank you SheHacks :)
